# ntwist-frontend-assignment

This project is a frontend assignment where we implement a contact form with validation, a sortable list viewer, an FAQ accordion (without JavaScript), and a star rating widget using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to showcase the use of semantic HTML, responsive CSS layouts, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and other best practices for building simple web applications.

## Pages Implemented

1. **Page 1 – Responsive Form with Validation**:
   - A form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
   - HTML5 validation for required fields, email type, and name pattern.
   - Tracks the time spent filling the form (from focus to submit).
   - Displays a confirmation message on successful form submission and clears the form.

2. **Page 2 – Sortable List Viewer**:
   - Displays a hardcoded list of names.
   - Includes a button to sort the list alphabetically using JavaScript.

3. **Page 3 – FAQ Accordion (No JS)**:
   - Implements an FAQ accordion using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
   - Allows users to expand and collapse questions using the `<details>` tag for interactivity.

## Features Added

- **Star Rating Widget**:
  - Allows users to click to rate from 1 to 5 stars using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Responsive Layout**:
  - The pages are built to be fully responsive using Flexbox and media queries.

- **CSS Grid/Flexbox for Layout**:
  - The project uses Flexbox for layout, especially for the sidebar and main content.

- **Semantic HTML**:
  - The project follows best practices for using semantic HTML tags, like `<form>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, and others.

- **Time Tracking for Form**:
  - Tracks how long the user takes to fill out the form and displays the elapsed time.
